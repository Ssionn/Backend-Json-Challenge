Alright, I've re-added that step:

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository-name.git
    ```

2. Change directory into the cloned repository.

    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

3. Install dependencies with Composer.

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file. You can use the `.env.example` as a base. Make sure to set your database configuration correctly in this file.

    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

## Usage:

Once you've set up the application, you can run the command to process the JSON file. Use the `import:users` command with the path to your JSON file as an argument:

```bash
php artisan import:users path-to-your-json-file.json
```

The command will parse the JSON file, create users and their associated credit cards, and log user names and ages to a file in the storage/logs directory. Note that users younger than 18 or older than 65 will not be imported.
